# The Hangman Game

My very first portfolio project I've decided to build. 

I've choosen Hangman since it has a simple business logic, so I can focus more on development rather than figuring out the rules and UX of my app. That is the same reason I've used Chakra UI here -- to focus on React, TypeScript and RTK Query instead of UI.

I hope you enjoy :)

## Tech stack used:

-   TypeScript
-   React
-   RTK Query
-   Chakra UI

Planning on adding web sockets for multiplayer purposes in the future
